## AutoLogin With Webbrowser


</div>

### Description

I searched long and hard for code that would allow me to auto login to my companies Email address through a VB6 Web Browser, I tried many different methods, and finaly I found that only a few lines of code were needed.

I hope this code is of use to someone, as I say I was at a loss for nearly a week.
